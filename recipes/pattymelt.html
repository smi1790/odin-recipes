    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A comforting grilled cheese sandwich and a delicious cheeseburger are combined in this juicy, satisfying patty melt, resulting in a mouthwatering meal. My family likes it best with Colby-Jack cheese and white bread, but you can easily substitute your favorite cheese/bread combo.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound 85% lean ground beef</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>                
            <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic</li>                
            <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>                
            <li>1 teaspoon Montreal-style steak seasoning</li>                
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed</li>                
            <li>6 slices white bread</li>                
            <li>6 slices Colby-Jack cheese</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine ground beef, parsley, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, and steak seasoning in a bowl; mix until thoroughly combined. Form into three equal patties.</li>
            <li>Heat a nonstick griddle over medium heat. Place burgers onto the warm griddle and cook to desired doneness, 4 to 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C). Remove burgers and set aside.</li>
            <li>Warm a second griddle over medium heat. Butter one side of each bread slice. Place 1/2 of the bread onto the griddle, buttered-side down. Add a slice of cheese, a burger, and a second slice of cheese to each one, then top with the remaining bread, buttered-side up.</li>
            <li>Cook until bread is golden brown and cheese is melted, 6 to 10 minutes, flipping halfway through.</li>
        </ol>
