    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This no-rise pizza dough recipe is quick and merely involves mixing a few basic ingredients and patting the dough into the pan â€” no need to wait for the dough to rise with this approach.</p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Mix in warm water and oil until dough comes together.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees C (190 degrees C). Pat and stretch dough onto a large pizza pan. Cover with desired toppings. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
